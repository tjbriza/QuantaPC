          Using Xendit as a payment method doesn't require you to sign up for a
          separate account. You'll simply be directed to the checkout page or a
          payment link to complete your transaction.

          WHAT TO EXPECT DURING PAYMENT

          <li>
            <strong>Information Needed:</strong> You'll only need to provide the
            information required by your chosen payment method. For instance, if
            you use a debit card, you'll need to enter your card details.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Verification:</strong> The verification process depends on
            the payment method you choose. For example, a service like GCash
            might send you a one-time password (OTP) to confirm your payment.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Fees:</strong> There are no extra fees for you to use
            Xendit. Any transaction fees for successful payments are paid by the
            merchant.

          "If you pay for an order with a credit or debit card, be ready to show
          the card you used and a valid ID when your package is delivered. If
          the card isn't in your name, you must provide an authorization letter
          from the cardholder explaining the purpose of the transaction. If you
          can't do this, your order may be canceled."
